Exploration vehicles such as a rover for mars exploration need to have autonomous navigation and location mapping. This is done via Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and this paper reviews the nVidia Jetson Tx2 board, evaluating its performance and comparing it to a workstation-grade computer for this task. This method is so important to study because previous attempts, such as wheel odometry, failed as a result of wheel slippage on sand. SLAM, on the other hand, provides a "probabilistic solution to the problem of simultaneously
building a map and localize a robot in it."

The nVidia Jetson TX2 showed signigicant performance gains in robusteness, resource utiliziation, and processed frames per seond with the emendded GPU. This provided a benchmark for SLAM algorithms using embedded computing platforms like the Jetson. The author's also concluded that more work needed to be done in order to increase the number of processed frames per second to match the target camera refresh rate.
