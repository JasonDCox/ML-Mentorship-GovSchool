# Implementation of Pet Detection and Recognition on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano

## Problem Statement 

A pet can approach the door to their home and be let in automatically. Currently, facial recognition is used for humans to access things such as their phones or open locks but this is not widely implemented in the same sense for animals and the most common solution to allowing free entry of pets is an unlockable door to the home. Most pets now have to rely on the attention and availablility of busy owners to let them out of possibly harsh conditions or face a security hazard with something like a conventional dog door. To avoid this, we plan to use the NVIDIA Jetson nano with software designed to automatically recognize a pet that matches what the user inputted into the program and unlock the door. This way, a user can add or remove pets and the door will only open to let in that specific pet. 

## Minimum Viable Product

This device, at the very least, should be able to tell if what is in front of the door is a dog, and then unlock or open the door.
