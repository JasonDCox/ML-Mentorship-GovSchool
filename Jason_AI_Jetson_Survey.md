Machine learning has been growing in popularity in recent years, especially neural networks.However, to actually become integrated into our daily lives, hardware needs to find the balance of low-power, cost, and weight, and high accuracy. This paper is a survey reviewing the NVIDIA Jetson platform for running neural network algorithms, describes the real world applications of these algorithms and reviews comparisons to the NVIDIA jetson from other platforms. Ultimately, their goal is to, "provide a glimpse of the recent progress towards AI for all".

The author concludes this paper by describing the challenges and future outlook for the NVIDIA jetson and other ML accelerators. Improvements need to be made in reducing the model-load latency as well as in all layers of system stack. Jetson, while good, is not the best that can be done and there will be a lot more development in the processor-design industry in the near future.
